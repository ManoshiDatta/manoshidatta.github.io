However, bulk copepod sampling averages over the variability in their associated bacterial communities, thereby limiting our understanding of the nature and specificity of copepod-bacteria associations. Here, we characterize the bacterial communities associated with nearly 200 individual Calanus finmarchicus copepods transitioning from active growth to diapause. We find that all individual copepods sampled share a small set of ``core'' operational taxonomic units (OTUs), a subset of which have also been found associated with other marine copepod species in different geographic locations. However, most OTUs are patchily distributed across individual copepods, thereby driving community differences across individuals. Among patchily distributed OTUs, we identified groups of OTUs correlated with common ecological drivers. For instance, a group of OTUs positively correlated with recent copepod feeding served to differentiate largely active growing copepods from those entering diapause. Together, our results underscore the power of individual-level sampling for understanding host-microbiome relationships.","tags":[],"title":"Inter-individual variability in copepod microbiomes reveals              bacterial networks linked to host physiology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tim N Enke*","**Manoshi S Datta***","Julia Schwartzman","Nathan Cermak","Desiree Schmitz","Julien Barrere","Otto X Cordero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514757600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514757600,"objectID":"d42e409b27f128068da6ef187d0893bc","permalink":"/publication/enke2018-ah/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/enke2018-ah/","section":"publication","summary":"Many complex biological systems such as metabolic networks can be divided into functional and organizational subunits, called modules, which provide the flexibility to assemble novel multi-functional hierarchies by a mix and match of simpler components. Here we show that polysaccharide-degrading microbial communities in the ocean can also assemble in a modular fashion. Using synthetic particles made of a variety of polysaccharides commonly found in the ocean, we showed that the particle colonization dynamics of natural bacterioplankton assemblages can be understood as the aggregation of species modules of two main types: a first module type made of narrow niche-range primary degraders, whose dynamics are controlled by particle polysaccharide composition, and a second module type containing broad niche-range, substrate-independent taxa whose dynamics are controlled by interspecific interactions, in particular cross-feeding via organic acids, amino acids and other metabolic byproducts. As a consequence of this modular logic, communities can be predicted to assemble by a sum of substrate-specific primary degrader modules, one for each complex polysaccharide in the particle, connected to a single broad-niche range consumer module. We validate this model by showing that a linear combination of the communities on single-polysaccharide particles accurately predicts community composition on mixed-polysaccharide particles. Our results suggest thus that the assembly of heterotrophic communities that degrade complex organic materials follow simple design principles that can be exploited to engineer heterotrophic microbiomes.","tags":["My work on microscale microbial ecology"],"title":"Modular assembly of polysaccharide-degrading microbial              communities in the ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nathan Cermak*","**Manoshi S Datta***","Arolyn Conwill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514757600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514757600,"objectID":"28adf02c6b0a9457a6f8148fe4016b0c","permalink":"/publication/cermak2018-gi/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cermak2018-gi/","section":"publication","summary":"Simple synthetic bacterial communities are powerful tools for studying microbial ecology and evolution, as they enable rapid iteration between controlled laboratory experiments and theoretical modeling. However, their utility is hampered by the lack of fast, inexpensive, and accurate methods for quantifying bacterial community composition. For instance, while next-generation amplicon sequencing can be very accurate, high costs (30 USD per sample) and turnaround times (1 month) limit the nature and pace of experiments. Here, we introduce a new approach for quantifying composition in synthetic bacterial communities based on Sanger sequencing. First, for a given community, we PCR-amplify a universal marker gene (here, the 16S rRNA gene), which yields a mixture of amplicons. Second, we sequence this amplicon mixture in a single Sanger sequencing reaction, which produces a mixed electropherogram with contributions from each community member. We also sequence each community member's marker gene individually to generate individual electropherograms. Third, we fit the mixed electropherogram as a linear combination of time-warped individual electropherograms, thereby allowing us to estimate the fractional amplicon abundance of each strain within the community. Importantly, our approach accounts for retention-time variability in electrophoretic signals, which is crucial for accurate compositional estimates. Using synthetic communities of marine bacterial isolates, we show that this approach yields accurate and reproducible abundance estimates for two-, four-, and seven-strain bacterial communities. Furthermore, this approach can provide results within one day and costs ~5 USD per sample. We envision this approach will enable new insights in microbial ecology by increasing the number of samples that can be analyzed and enabling faster iteration between experiments and theory. We have implemented our method in a free and open-source R package called CASEU (Compositional Analysis by Sanger Electropherogram Unmixing), available at https://bitbucket.org/DattaManoshi/caseu.","tags":["computational"],"title":"Rapid, inexpensive measurement of synthetic bacterial community composition by Sanger sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

Yet the degree to which genes and pathways can contribute to an organism's fitness on such complex and variable natural resource landscapes remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the gene-by-gene fitness of a generalist saprophytic marine bacterium (Vibrio sp. F13 9CS106) on complex resources derived from its natural habitats - copepods (Apocyclops royi) and brown algae (Fucus vesiculosus) - and as reference substrates, glucose and the polysaccharide alginate, derived from brown algal cell walls. We find that resource complexity strongly buffers fitness costs of mutations, and that anabolic rather than catabolic pathways are more stringently required, likely due to functional redundancy in the latter. Moreover, while carbohydrate-rich algae requires several synthesis pathways, protein-rich Apocyclops does not, suggesting this ancestral habitat for Vibrios is a replete medium with metabolically redundant substrates. We also identify a candidate fitness trade-off for algal colonization: deletion of mshA increases mutant fitness. Our results demonstrate that gene fitness depends on habitat composition, and suggest that this generalist uses distinct resources in different natural habitats. The results further indicate that substrate replete conditions may lead to relatively relaxed selection on catabolic genes.","tags":["My work on microscale microbial ecology"],"title":"Natural resource landscapes of a marine bacterium reveal distinct              fitness-determining genes across the genome","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Rationale  \u0026ldquo;Microbes are small; their environments are also small.\u0026rdquo; - T.S. Brock.\n Individual microbes (~1 µm) sense and respond to their local microenvironment, which often has a characteristic length scale of ~100 µm. However, microbial communities in the wild are typically studied at human-centric scales (meters or more). This has limited our ability to identify mechanistic drivers of microbial activity, infer meaningful interaction networks, and rationally engineer microbial communities.\nApproach In the ocean, marine detritus (like dead copepods or fish poop) provide nutrient-rich microhabitats where microbial communities can form. Inspired by this example, I have used microbial communities on marine particles as a model system for microscale microbial ecology. I\u0026rsquo;ve taken multiple complementary approaches to exploring this topic: What we\u0026rsquo;ve learned  Marine bacteria form communities on microscale particle microhabitats, including naturally occurring particles (e.g., copepods; Datta\u0026#42;, Almada\u0026#42;, et al., 2018) and synthetic particles in the laboratory (Datta, et al., 2016; Enke\u0026#42;, Datta\u0026#42;, et al., 2018). Community assembly occurs via an ecological succession in the laboratory: early stages are dominated by particle-degrading \u0026ldquo;pioneers\u0026rdquo;, who provide metabolic byproducts for late-stage colonization (Datta, et al., 2016). We find that this pattern holds for communities formed on a wide range of carbohydrate-rich particles (Enke\u0026#42;, Datta\u0026#42;, et al., 2018). Migration on patchy landscapes, like those in the ocean, can promote cooperation in microbial populations. (Datta, et al., 2013).

Conversely, organisms that antagonize each other will tend to spatially segregate, creating distinct micro-communities and increased diversity at larger length scales.

Recent theoretical work suggests that range expansions can have a strong effect on evolution, even leading to the fixation of deleterious alleles that would normally be outcompeted in the absence of migration. However, little is known about how range expansions might influence alleles under frequency- or density-dependent selection. Moreover, there is very little experimental evidence to complement existing theory, since expanding populations are difficult to study in the natural environment. In this study, we have used a yeast experimental system to explore the effect of range expansions on the maintenance of cooperative behaviors, which commonly display frequency- and density-dependent selection and are widespread in nature. We found that range expansions favor the maintenance of cooperation in two ways: (i) through the enrichment of cooperators at the front of the expanding population and (ii) by allowing cooperators to ``outrun'' an invading wave of defectors. In this system, cooperation is enhanced through the coupling of population ecology and evolutionary dynamics in expanding populations, thus providing experimental evidence for a unique mechanism through which cooperative behaviors could be maintained in nature.","tags":["My work on microscale microbial ecology"],"title":"Range expansion promotes cooperation in an experimental microbial              metapopulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
